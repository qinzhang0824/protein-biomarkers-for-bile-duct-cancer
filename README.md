1. Raw input data
   
(1)Instrumental variables of plasma proteins used in MR analysis

The cis-pQTLs were selected based on the following criteria:
(a). SNPs linked to any protein with a significance level of P < 5×10-8 were included;
(b). SNPs and proteins located within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6 (25.5–34.0 Mb) were excluded because of the intricate linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in this area;
(c). subsequently, LD clumping was performed to identify independent protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) for each protein, ensuring that variants had an r² value less than 0.001;


(2)Three GWAS summary data of BTC patients



1. The "Data" folder contains the original or preliminary input data used in the MR analysis process.
2. The "Analysis_data" folder contains some intermediate files or result files generated during the MR analysis process.
3. For SMR and HEIDI analysis, refer to https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/smr/#SMR&HEIDIanalysis.
